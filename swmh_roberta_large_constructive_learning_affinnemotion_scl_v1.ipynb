tonight about depression...for the first time in over a year i have hope that things can get better. hi, i've been depressed for over a year. i still am depressed, but for the first time throughout this hell i actually have gained some insight and now i have hope that things can get better. for me this is really a breath of fresh air because my depression has literally been suffocating me for so long. i know this won't necessarily apply to everyone but i really hope what i share can maybe give some people insight and hope as well. at first i thought my depression was a result of my loneliness. i was able to function okay at work and around people, but when i got home alone it felt like the walls were caving on on me. my mind would race with suicidal and self loathing thoughts. i hate you , kill yourself , why are you so stupid ...just examples of things i would say in my head to myself. it is very overwhelming to be in this state of mind and for a long time i thought the only way i would ever be able to find peace of mind is through suicide. i was hospitalized a few months ago for suicidal ideation by my co worker, who had me admitted when i told her i was constantly thinking about killing myself. my hospitalization was tramtic, i felt trapped. nobody tried to help me. i was isolated in a room for 3 days...it felt like prison. to this day i still think that my hospitalization only made my depression worse. it was really the first time anyone showed that they would do anything they could to help me though, and to this day i will never forget that my co worker really cared about me and was worried sick about what i told her. i was prescribed wellbutrin while hospitalized. i didn't get any therapy in the hospital, nobody tried to help me conquer my depression. i got the feeling my psychiatrist was just prescribing me a pill, expecting it to fix me. although they told me how important therapy was in combination with medication, i didn't really understand that until now. so i learned tonight, after being on wellbutrin for over 5 months that antidepressants don't actually do anything for depression itself at least for me . they only suppress the symptoms of depression. for me wellbutrin didnt make me happy, or able to feel emotion. it just gave me energy. it allowed me to wake up and not feel completely drained of energy and unable to move. for the duration i've been on wellbutrin i could still feel my depression mounting and it continued to get worse. the physical symptoms of depression were completely debilitating tonight for me. at work there was no real reason for me to be depressed, there wasn't anything affecting my emotions...i just felt it. i couldn't focus, i couldn't smile i do door to door work, having a genuine smile is very important, people can definitely tell when you're faking , i couldn't connect with people, i couldn't think...my mind wasnt racing it really just felt...kind of blah...like i couldnt get in a peaceful state of mind even though there wasnt anything bringing me down. i ended up leaving work because i just couldn't get my mind straight. i had to walk about 3 miles to get back to my car so i started talking to my sister who is very experienced with mental problems, her spouse is bpd, severely depressed, suicidal etc . my mom had actually called her concerned because for the last few days i have been telling my mom that im suicidal, i just want the pain to end. after thinking carefully about things i came to the conclusion that i don't actually want to die or commit suicide. it's just that the feeling produced by my depression is so severe, that i couldn't think of any other way to express the severity of the way i feel other than to say i want to die, i want to kill myself . so i told my sister...instead of saying i want to die i would start saying i want this feeling to stop . this was really the first awakening moment for me tonight. i realized that i really do want to live...i just don't want to feel like this anymore and for a long time i thought the only way that i could achieve peace of mind was through suicide. then i started thinking about why welbutrin wasnt doing anything for the feeling that my depression produces...it wasnt doing anything for the certain feeling in the pit of my stomach...its like an overwhelming feeling of emptiness.but it was helping the symptoms. at this point i learned that the symptoms of depression, and depression itself are not the same thing. i now see my depression as a disease, that will probably never go away. the medication can help suppress the symptoms of my disease and make it easier to live with, and therapy can help me control and cope with the disease itself. now i have a plan of action for how i can survive this horrible condition even though i know it will never go away. i don't feel happy but i find some comfort in knowing that there are things i can do to feel better, even though i know i will probably never feel normal or like i did before i became depressed . thanks for reading i hope some of the thing's i've learned might help some other people. especially the part about me not wanting die, but just being unable to express the severity of how depression makes me feel. what i really crave the most is peace of mind... and i think i've discovered a plan to gain some peace.\n","Label:

many shoulds but nothink i want to so. an essay due monday? that's just another flicker of thought triggered by sheer sense of responsibility, not by my own conscious will. besides, who cares about tests and essays when you're thinking about suicide. one week blurs into the next with only another bland weekend in which nothing happens in between. i feel deader than dead. i lived with it for a long while and was diagnosed when it developed suicidal after so many years. child depression really goes unnoticed, especially because you yourself is not old and knowledgeable enough to recognize it as depression in the first place. the meds work and i'm lucky enough to have money to buy them, but i don't know if they really help. the logical side of me says this is just another bottom of the ocean deep low phase in my unending cycle of ups and downs. the real me says whatever, i just want to be gone and free from the pain that is life. the only reason i held on so far is my parents. they did nothing to deserve a dead child. i wouldn't be able to repay their love and for the longest time i am just a medicine run burden. i wish i could love them back. i do love them but i just don't feel anything. it's hard to feel pain, to laugh, to even cry anymore. i'm drained and numb. as dead as dead without physically being dead. i'm a machine that runs on medicine. a ghost that breathes. about time i'm done holding out. once upon a time i had a dream. an unrealistic one that even i didn't beleive in. i wanted to be a doctor. a loving doctor who would smile and wave as discharged patients left the hospital. i wanted to help people. to work with groups like doctors without borders and go heal those in need of help. i went to college and realized how the brutal path was simply not for someone of my level. i'm neither smart enough, motivated enough, not dead enough, or probably going to be alive long enough. it's all a sci fi fantasy now, since dreams became obsolete since i

the fence about my bipolar diagnosis for years. depression yes, hypomania, well maybe not sure. i took adderall on and off since high school, and it is hard to know if the hypomania i felt was organic or due to amphetamines mimicking hypmomanic mood very well. the episode always wore off as soon as the adderall did, but i didn't always have this reaction to it, all of a sudden it seemed episodic whether it elevated me or calmed my focus. so my issue is, i've also taken only fluoxetine since i was 16. i am 26 now, and for the rest of high school and some college it seemed to work very well. in college, i experienced a lot of elevated anxiety so i paired it with a mood stabilizer and it's been great. but recently i've experienced so much unreal anxiety and i'm wondering if that is what's causing it. my anxiety manifests in physical symptoms a lot, like racing heart and quick breathing, so i increased the ssri, and now it seems even worse mostly physically . i'll be sleeping and be woken up by me tensing my muscles. can your diagnosis evolve over time from a depressive disorder due to developing the elevated symptoms of bipolar disorder? i know ssris are traditionally not recommended for this disorder, even though it very much helps those with unipolar depression. just trying to figure myself out before i make changes for the new year\n","Label: 2\n","Emotion Score:

didn t work. i told her the truth, eventually. but is there any honor in that? there is some honor in telling the truth in those situations. when you are forced to be truthful, it gets taken away. she forgave me, eventually. but she did not forget. she went off to college it was a no brainer, we were going to stay together forever. we had our differences we began to grow in our different ways but we made it work. year after year. struggle after struggle. little lie, after little lie i forgive you please don t do it again please don t break my heart. i love you i won t i love you too i did. i don t have an excuse for what i did. i didn t cheat on her. i didn t kill anyone. but i did lie to her we were high school sweethearts we dated through college i constantly thought about how i would propose would i sing? would it be at the beach? would i have her family there? should i wait a year or two after her graduation? how should i ask her? oh man i have to ask her parents for permission damn it i can t wait. this is going to be perfect. she is perfect. a lie. a lie ruined my life. there comes a time in every man s life when they are faced with the moral challenge . do i lie? do i tell the truth? i chose to lie she chose to say goodbye i m ashamed. this is a flaw that i knew i had. the little white lie that i told as a kid, it snowballed. the infamous nasty habit, became a nasty habit of mine. it defined me. it defined my breakup. do i accept this as my way of life? fuck no. there comes a time in every man s life when he has to choose to grow out of childish habits. what some forget is that you have to stay conscious of the fact that you have these habits. otherwise, you go back to your nasty ways. i chose to make this decision today again i chose to make this decision too late again i can only hope that this beautiful girl will forgive me i can only hope that god finds me worthy of her forgiveness i can only hope\n","Label: 4\n","Emotion Score:

things are crashing down on me, but i can t feel anything besides consistent despair. on the outside, i may look successful. i earned a college degree at the age of 18, and i ve worked for unc, one of the most prestigious public universities in the united states. i have my own apartment at the age of 20, and i have a loving family and a puppy who keeps me company. i am also supposed to be a good christian girl, and i used to attend the local coptic church regularly. beyond my sunny exterior, like i said earlier, i only have dread. i have hated the fact that i have these mean voices in my head telling me that no one truly cares about me. i have hated the fact that i was so insecure about my weight, and have tried to starve myself to stay skinny if i ate, i would try anything in my power to regurgitate the food that i ate. i have hated the fact that i have stopped attending classes at unc, going to church, going to therapy, and going to work like i used to. all i can bear to do now is to sell my own body for work, and drink to ease the pain. the reason why? that s the only way i have known to ever feel loved. i was raped since the age of 16 until just recently, and every single day i subconsciously have felt that if no one loves how i look or calls me beautiful that i am worthless. you may ask why i cannot go to my parents or anybody from my church to ask for help. the thing is, i feel as if i don t deserve their help. my parents did not choose to have a daughter like me who has went through so much. people from my church are good people while i am a wretched human being who has done so many horrible things. besides, i am sure they know that i am not like them. i do all sorts of evil sins, so i would definitely be far from being a good child of god. i am tormented daily. in the morning, by my lack of desire to get up and be productive. at night, by my consistent nightmares. it is all just torture. if i can disappear from existence and not have to experience the pain of death, i would have done it. right now, i am just trying to decide if disappearing from existence is worth experiencing the pain of death.\n","Label: 1\n","Emotion Score: 0.4560\n","\n","Text: guided meditation disclaimer i am in no way saying meditation should be the sole method of treating bipolar disorder. i wouldn't be stable enough to meditate without my meds. just sharing an experience. i attended my first guided meditation session today and found it really helpful. my mind has been racing for days. just random thoughts pushing out other random thoughts. 25 minutes in a dimly lit room listening to the soothing voice of someone guiding images was nice. my mind wandered as she read, but she instructed me to acknowledge the thoughts and gently push them away. ptsd tells me not to close my eyes in the room with a stranger bipolar disorder tells me i can't sit still mentally or physically long enough to get through a guided meditation. but get through it i did, and it was very helpful. it was conducted in a little shop in our downtown area and only cost 5. if you're interested in meditation, it might be something to check out in your area. just my
